# **App Name**: BillTrack

## Core Features:

- Bill Input: Users can input the name, amount, and due date for each bill.
- Monthly View: Displays all bills due in the current month, ordered by due date.
- Payment Tracking: Users can check off bills as 'paid,' moving them to the bottom of the list with a 'paid' tag.
- Mobile Widget: Widget that displays a summary of bills due for the current month on the device's home screen.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080), conveying reliability and focus.
- Background color: Light grayish-teal (#E0EEEE), complementing the primary color while maintaining a clean, unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#D4AF37), drawing attention to key actions such as payment confirmations.
- Use clear and modern sans-serif fonts for easy readability on mobile devices.
- Prioritize a clean, list-based layout that clearly distinguishes each bill item and its details (amount, due date, status).
- Use recognizable icons for bill categories (e.g., a house for rent/mortgage, a plug for utilities).
- Use subtle transitions for marking bills as paid or for moving them in the list.
